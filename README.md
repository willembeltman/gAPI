# gAPI (Generated API Framework)

This package name has been reserved for a new open-source project: **gAPI** – a framework for auto-generating fast, type-safe API communication layers between client and server.

More information and the first release (v0.0.1) will be available in the coming weeks.

Stay tuned!
